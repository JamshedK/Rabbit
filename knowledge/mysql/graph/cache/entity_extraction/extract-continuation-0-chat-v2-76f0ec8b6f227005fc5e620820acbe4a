The disadvantage of a small innodb_concurrency_tickets value is that large transactions must loop through the queue many times before they can complete, which extends the amount of time required to complete their task.With a large innodb_concurrency_tickets value, large transactions spend less time waiting for a position at the end of the queue (controlled by innodb_thread_concurrency) and more time retrieving rows. Large transactions also require fewer trips through the queue to complete their task.

To avoid “read-on-write”, set innodb_log_write_ahead_size to match the operating system or file system cache block size. The default setting is 8192 bytes. Read-on-write occurs when redo log blocks are not entirely cached to the operating system or file system due to a mismatch between write-ahead block size for the redo log and operating system or file system cache block size. Valid values for innodb_log_write_ahead_size are multiples of the InnoDB log file block size (2n). The minimum value is the InnoDB log file block size (512). Write-ahead does not occur when the minimum value is specified. The maximum value is equal to the innodb_page_size value.
