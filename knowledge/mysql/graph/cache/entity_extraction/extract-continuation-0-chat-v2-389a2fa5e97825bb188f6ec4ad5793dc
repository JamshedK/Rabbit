Write lock requests have higher priority than read lock requests. However, if max_write_lock_count is set to some low value (say, 10), read lock requests may be preferred over pending write lock requests if the read lock requests have already been passed over in favor of 10 write lock requests.

This setting provides the best performance, but in the event of a power failure or operating system crash, it is possible that the server has committed transactions that have not been synchronized to the binary log.sync_binlog=1: Enables synchronization of the binary log to disk before transactions are committed. This is the safest setting but can have a negative impact on performance due to the increased number of disk writes. In the event of a power failure or operating system crash, transactions that are missing from the binary log are only in a prepared state. This permits the automatic recovery routine to roll back the transactions, which guarantees that no transaction is lost from the binary log.sync_binlog=N, where N is a value other than 0 or 1: The binary log is synchronized to disk after N binary log commit groups have been collected. In the event of a power failure or operating system crash, it is possible that the server has committed transactions that have not been flushed to the binary log.

For example, suppose that your system typically has 40 to 50 users, but periodically the number increases to 60, 70, or more. Through testing, you find that performance remains largely stable with a limit of 80 concurrent users. In this case, set innodb_thread_concurrency to 80.If you do not want InnoDB to use more than a certain number of virtual CPUs for user threads (20 virtual CPUs, for example), set innodb_thread_concurrency to this number (or possibly lower, depending on performance testing). If your goal is to isolate MySQL from other applications, consider binding the mysqld process exclusively to the virtual CPUs. Be aware, however, that exclusive binding can result in non-optimal hardware usage if the mysqld process is not consistently busy. In this case, you can bind the mysqld process to the virtual CPUs but allow other applications to use some or all of the virtual CPUs.\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"thread_cache_size\",\n\"description\": \"How many threads the server should cache for reuse. When a client disconnects, the client's threads are put in the cache if there are fewer than thread_cache_size threads there. Requests for threads are satisfied by reusing threads taken from the cache if possible, and only when the cache is empty is a new thread created. This variable can be increased to improve performance if you have a lot of new connections. Normally, this does not provide a notable performance improvement if you have a good thread implementation. However, if your server sees hundreds of connections per second you should normally set thread_cache_size high enough so that most new connections use cached threads. By examining the difference between the Connections and Threads_created status variables, you can see how efficient the thread cache is. \"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"binlog\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>INNODB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>InnoDB is a storage engine for MySQL known for its support of ACID transactions, foreign keys, and crash recovery.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYSQL SERVER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MySQL Server is an open-source relational database management system, widely used for database storage and management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THREAD CACHE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Thread Cache is a MySQL resource that allows for caching and reusing threads to improve performance in handling connections to the database.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADAPTIVE FLUSHING<|>EVENT<|>Adaptive flushing is a performance optimization in InnoDB that enables it to dynamically manage the flushing of data to disk based on the system's workload.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PURGE LAG<|>EVENT<|>Purge lag is a condition in which the processing of DELETE and UPDATE operations is delayed to allow time for the removal of obsolete data in InnoDB.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BINARY LOG<|>EVENT<|>The binary log is a set of log files that record all changes to the database; it is used for replication and recovery of transactions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOCK REQUEST<|>EVENT<|>Lock requests occur when multiple threads try to access the same database resources, which can lead to contention and require management.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INNODB<|>MYSQL SERVER<|>InnoDB is the storage engine that operates within the MySQL Server, enhancing its capability to manage data and transactions effectively.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THREAD CACHE<|>MYSQL SERVER<|>Thread Cache optimizes the performance of MySQL Server by caching threads for reuse, reducing the overhead of creating new threads.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADAPTIVE FLUSHING<|>INNODB<|>Adaptive flushing is an operational feature of InnoDB that adjusts data flushing to optimize performance based on current load.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PURGE LAG<|>INNODB<|>Purge lag is a concept within InnoDB's data management that ensures smooth data operations without delay from data removal processes.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BINARY LOG<|>MYSQL SERVER<|>The binary log is a critical component of MySQL Server that ensures data consistency and supports recovery and replication operations.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOCK REQUEST<|>MYSQL SERVER<|>Lock requests are essential to maintaining data integrity within MySQL Server when multiple database operations occur simultaneously.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
