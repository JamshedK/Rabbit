This variable can be increased to improve performance if you have a lot of new connections. Normally, this does not provide a notable performance improvement if you have a good thread implementation. However, if your server sees hundreds of connections per second you should normally set thread_cache_size high enough so that most new connections use cached threads. By examining the difference between the Connections and Threads_created status variables, you can see how efficient the thread cache is. \"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"binlog_group_commit_sync_delay\",\n\"description\": \"Controls how many microseconds the binary log commit waits before synchronizing the binary log file to disk. By default binlog_group_commit_sync_delay is set to 0, meaning that there is no delay. Setting binlog_group_commit_sync_delay to a microsecond delay enables more transactions to be synchronized together to disk at once, reducing the overall time to commit a group of transactions because the larger groups require fewer time units per group.When sync_binlog=0 or sync_binlog=1 is set, the delay specified by binlog_group_commit_sync_delay is applied for every binary log commit group before synchronization (or in the case of sync_binlog=0, before proceeding). When sync_binlog is set to a value n greater than 1, the delay is applied after every n binary log commit groups.\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"binlog_group_commit_sync_no_delay_count\",\n\"description\": \"The maximum number of transactions to wait for before aborting the current delay as specified by binlog_group_commit_sync_delay.

The value is expressed as a sum of CPU core usage. For example, The default value of 80 is 80% of a single CPU core.

For example, 100% usage of two CPU cores is 50% of the combined CPU processing power on a server with four CPU cores.The innodb_log_spin_cpu_pct_hwm variable respects processor affinity.

If max_relay_log_size is greater than 0, it constrains the size of the relay log, which enables you to have different sizes for the two logs.

The value must be a multiple of 4KB.
