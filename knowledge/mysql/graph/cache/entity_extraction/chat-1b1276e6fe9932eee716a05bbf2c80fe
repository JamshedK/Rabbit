If an internal in-memory temporary table exceeds this size, it is automatically converted to an on-disk internal temporary table. The tmp_table_size variable does not apply to user-created MEMORY tables. User-created TempTable tables are not supported. When using the MEMORY storage engine for internal in-memory temporary tables, the actual size limit is the smaller of tmp_table_size and max_heap_table_size. The max_heap_table_size setting does not apply to TempTable tables. Increase the value of tmp_table_size (and max_heap_table_size if necessary when using the MEMORY storage engine for internal in-memory temporary tables) if you do many advanced GROUP BY queries and you have lots of memory.\"\n},\n{\n\"name\":\"max_heap_table_size\",\n\"description\":\"This variable sets the maximum size to which user-created MEMORY tables are permitted to grow. The value of the variable is used to calculate MEMORY table MAX_ROWS values. Setting this variable has no effect on any existing MEMORY table, unless the table is re-created with a statement such as CREATE TABLE or altered with ALTER TABLE or TRUNCATE TABLE. A server restart also sets the maximum size of existing MEMORY tables to the global max_heap_table_size value. This variable is also used in conjunction with tmp_table_size to limit the size of internal in-memory tables. \"\n},\n{\n\"name\":\"query_prealloc_size\",\n\"description\":\"As of MySQL 8.0.29, query_prealloc_size is deprecated, and setting it no longer has any effect; you should expect its removal in a future release of MySQL\"\n},\n{\n\"name\":\"sort_buffer_size\",\n\"description\":\"Each session that must perform a sort allocates a buffer of this size. sort_buffer_size is not specific to any storage engine and applies in a general manner for optimization. At minimum the sort_buffer_size value must be large enough to accommodate fifteen tuples in the sort buffer. Also, increasing the value of max_sort_length may require increasing the value of sort_buffer_size. If you see many Sort_merge_passes per second in SHOW GLOBAL STATUS output, you can consider increasing the sort_buffer_size value to speed up ORDER BY or GROUP BY operations that cannot be improved with query optimization or improved indexing. The optimizer tries to work out how much space is needed but can allocate more, up to the limit. Setting it larger than required globally slows down most queries that perform sorts. It is best to increase it as a session setting, and only for the sessions that need a larger size. On Linux, there are thresholds of 256KB and 2MB where larger values may significantly slow down memory allocation, so you should consider staying below one of those values.\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n\"description\":\"The size in bytes of the buffer pool, the memory area where InnoDB caches table and index data. The maximum value depends on the CPU architecture. When the size of the buffer pool is greater than 1GB, setting innodb_buffer_pool_instances to a value greater than 1 can improve the scalability on a busy server. A larger buffer pool requires less disk I/O to access the same table data more than once. On a dedicated database server, you might set the buffer pool size to 80% of the machine's physical memory size. \"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct_lwm\",\n\"description\":\"Defines a low water mark representing the percentage of dirty pages at which preflushing is enabled to control the dirty page ratio. A value of 0 disables the pre-flushing behavior entirely. The configured value should always be lower than the innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct value. \"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"innodb_purge_threads\",\n\"description\": \"The number of background threads devoted to the InnoDB purge operation. Increasing the value creates additional purge threads, which can improve efficiency on systems where DML operations are performed on multiple tables.\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"table_open_cache_instances\",\n\"description\":\"The number of open tables cache instances. To improve scalability by reducing contention among sessions, the open tables cache can be partitioned into several smaller cache instances of size table_open_cache / table_open_cache_instances. A value of 8 or 16 is recommended on systems that routinely use 16 or more cores. However, if you have many large triggers on your tables that cause a high memory load, the default setting for table_open_cache_instances might lead to excessive memory usage. \"\n},\n{\n\"name\":\"innodb_compression_failure_threshold_pct\",\n\"description\":\"Defines the compression failure rate threshold for a table, as a percentage, at which point MySQL begins adding padding within compressed pages to avoid expensive compression failures. When this threshold is passed, MySQL begins to leave additional free space within each new compressed page, dynamically adjusting the amount of free space up to the percentage of page size specified by innodb_compression_pad_pct_max. A value of zero disables the mechanism that monitors compression efficiency and dynamically adjusts the padding amount.\"\n},\n{\n\"name\":\"innodb_change_buffering\",\n\"description\":\"Whether InnoDB performs change buffering, an optimization that delays write operations to secondary indexes so that the I/O operations can be performed sequentially.
