There is one such log file for each index being created or table being altered. This log file stores data inserted, updated, or deleted in the table during the DDL operation. The temporary log file is extended when needed by the value of innodb_sort_buffer_size, up to the maximum specified by innodb_online_alter_log_max_size. If a temporary log file exceeds the upper size limit, the ALTER TABLE operation fails and all uncommitted concurrent DML operations are rolled back. Thus, a large value for this option allows more DML to happen during an online DDL operation, but also extends the period of time at the end of the DDL operation when the table is locked to apply the data from the log.\"\n},\n{\n\"name\":\"innodb_purge_batch_size\",\n\"description\":\"Defines the number of undo log pages that purge parses and processes in one batch from the history list. In a multithreaded purge configuration, the coordinator purge thread divides innodb_purge_batch_size by innodb_purge_threads and assigns that number of pages to each purge thread. The innodb_purge_batch_size variable also defines the number of undo log pages that purge frees after every 128 iterations through the undo logs.\"\n},\n{\n\"name\":\"innodb_lru_scan_depth\",\n\"description\": \"A parameter that influences the algorithms and heuristics for the flush operation for the InnoDB buffer pool. Primarily of interest to performance experts tuning I/O-intensive workloads. It specifies, per buffer pool instance, how far down the buffer pool LRU page list the page cleaner thread scans looking for dirty pages to flush. This is a background operation performed once per second. A setting smaller than the default is generally suitable for most workloads. A value that is much higher than necessary may impact performance. Only consider increasing the value if you have spare I/O capacity under a typical workload. Conversely, if a write-intensive workload saturates your I/O capacity, decrease the value, especially in the case of a large buffer pool. When tuning innodb_lru_scan_depth, start with a low value and configure the setting upward with the goal of rarely seeing zero free pages. \"\n},\n{\n\"name\":\"innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct\",\n\"description\":\"InnoDB tries to flush data from the buffer pool so that the percentage of dirty pages does not exceed this value.

The default value is 8. Increasing the value improves the accuracy of index statistics, which can improve the query execution plan, at the expense of increased I/O when opening an InnoDB table or recalculating statistics. Setting a high value for innodb_stats_transient_sample_pages could result in lengthy ANALYZE TABLE execution time. innodb_stats_transient_sample_pages only applies when innodb_stats_persistent is disabled for a table; when innodb_stats_persistent is enabled, innodb_stats_persistent_sample_pages applies instead.

The following example illustrates the effect of increasing the default value.\"\n},\n{\n\"name\":\"innodb_spin_wait_delay\",\n\"description\":\"The maximum delay between polls for a spin lock. The low-level implementation of this mechanism varies depending on the combination of hardware and operating system, so the delay does not correspond to a fixed time interval.
